# EpicBattles
 A small text battle game that was inspired by Terraria Discord server's Epic Battle Dryad Bot. It has some texts that are quite graphic or reference things that not everyone might understand, so take that at risk.
### IMPORTANT - MAKE SURE TO HAVE .NET FRAMEWORK 8.0 INSTALLED BEFORE RUNNING THE GAME

By the way, if Microsoft Defender doesn't want to install the file due to a trojan, it's a false positive - you can check the source code yourself, and I have scanned all the files with VirusTotal just in case. (Even if I know that the offending DLL was autogenerated by Visual Studio 2022)
